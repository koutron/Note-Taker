# Note-Taker

## Description
This application allows you to take notes and store them in a JSON database file.  Notes that are created are persisted to a list and can later be viewed.  Notes can also be deleted from the list and the database file.

## Installation
Express is a dependency of this package. Run "npm install" to install it.

## Usage
Type into the "Note Title" and "Note Text" fields.  Once both fields have content, click the disk icon in the top left to save the note.  Clicking the pencil icon removes any data from the note being created.
